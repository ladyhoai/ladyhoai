- 👀 I’m interested in Virtual Reality, Robots and Ascii games. My wildest dream is to create a "cyberpunk" world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++. I'm scheming about a software that integrates the entire world into a VR headset, and everyone can interact with each other. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C++. I'm currently struggling with building animation.
